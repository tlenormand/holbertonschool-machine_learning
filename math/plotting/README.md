# Plotting

## Description
This project is about plotting, which is the graphical representation of data. It is a fundamental part of data analysis and presentation. It is also a key component of machine learning, as it allows us to visualize the data we are working with and the results of our algorithms. In this project, we will be using the `matplotlib` library to create plots and graphs.
