# Calculus

## Description
This project is about calculus, which is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. It has two major branches, differential calculus (concerning instantaneous rates of change and slopes of curves), and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of amounts and the areas under and between curves). These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Calculus has many practical applications, including modeling physical phenomena such as motion, as well as design and optimization problems in many different fields. It is also a major part of modern mathematics education.
